# Coding Challenge Template for ISM3232

Here is a coding challenge template for the coding challenges related to ISM3232.

Please remember to update the **script file name** for each coding challenge so that it matches the specific challenge number.

### ‚úÖ What You Need to Do

1. **Rename the script file**:

   * For Coding Challenge 1 ‚Üí `cc_1.js`
   * For Coding Challenge 2 ‚Üí `cc_2.js`
   * And so on for each challenge.

2. **Update the script tag in your HTML file**:
   In your `index.html`, make sure the `<script>` tag points to the correct file. For example:

   ```html
   <!-- Example for Coding Challenge 1 -->
   <script src="cc_1.js"></script>
   ```

   ```html
   <!-- Example for Coding Challenge 2 -->
   <script src="cc_2.js"></script>
   ```

### üìù Using the Templates

You are welcome to use the **attached template files** (`index.html` and `script.js`) as your starting point. Just remember to rename the script file and update the `<script>` tag each time you begin a new coding challenge.

### üö® Why This Matters

* If you do not update both the file name **and** the HTML `<script>` tag, your code will not run correctly.
* This step is part of the grading criteria, so be sure to check carefully before submission.
